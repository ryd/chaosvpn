Preface
=======

Welcome to ChaosVPN! This document is a step-by-step guide
to getting into the chaosvpn network. To join chaosvpn, you need to
install some software (tinc, chaosvpn). You also have to register your
node before you can connect to the rest of the network.

Preparation
===========

If you are using debian, you can use haegar's repository: (If you're
not using debian, you can compile the chaosvpn binary yourself (see
below) and install tinc by some other means)

# echo "deb     http://debian.sdinet.de/ squeeze chaosvpn" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
# echo "deb-src http://debian.sdinet.de/ squeeze chaosvpn" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

Also you need to install the signing key:

# wget -q http://debian.sdinet.de/signkey.asc -O- | apt-key add -

Then you can update the apt cache and install tinc. Tinc has a
dependency on liblzo. So please install it together.

# apt-get update
# apt-get install tinc

As tinc was installed, you have to create the needed folders and the
key files for your machine. In this example, we call the network
"chaos" and tinc will create public and private keys for your machine
with 2048 bit.

# mkdir -p /etc/tinc/chaos/hosts
# tincd -n chaos -K 2048

You can save the generated key files on their default location.


Requirements
============

If you want install the chaosvpn software from source, you also need
to install the following packages:

* gnu make
* flex
* byacc
* gcc
* libssl-dev


Building ChaosVPN
=================

You should get the latest git snapshot of the chaosvpn repository:

# git clone git://github.com/ryd/chaosvpn.git

To compile chaosvpn, simply do:
# cd chaosvpn
# make
# make install

After successful installation, open
    /etc/tinc/chaosvpn.conf

and edit the file to suit your needs. This file contains helpful
comments guiding you through the process.

If you want to generate a debian package of the current git snapshot then
instead of "make + make install" execute "make deb" - this will create a
.deb package in the parent directory which you can install with "dpkg -i"

Publishing your details
=======================

Now we need some details from your machine to publish it to all other
nodes within the ChaosVPN. You can fill your details into this
template:

(Remove the comment lines starting with # before sending)

----------------------------------------------------------------
[<nodename>]
# This nodename or sometimes called peer-id is the name of the network
# endpoint/gateway where the vpn software will be running, not necessarily
# the name of the user, there may even be more than one gateway per user.
#
# Please use only characters a-z, 0-9 and _ in it. 

gatewayhost=<clienthost>
# This should be the external hostname or ip address of the client host, not
# a VPN address.
# If the client is not reachable over the internet leave it out and set
# hidden=1 below.
# If possible supply a hostname (even dyndns) and not an ip address for
# easier changing
# from your side without touching the central config.

network=<ipv4 subnet in the vpn>
network6=<ipv6 subnet in the vpn>
# (mandatory, must include)
# this may be more than one, IPv4 or IPv6, network6 with  IPv6 is optional
#
# These subnets must be unique in our vpn,
# simply renumber your home network (or use something like NETMAP) with a
# network block that is still free.
#
# Please select an unused IPv4 range out of
# https://wiki.hamburg.ccc.de/ChaosVPN:IPRanges, and
# write yourself down in that wiki page to mark your future range as in-use.
# Please select from the correct ranges, 172.31.*.* for Europe, and 10.100.*.*
# for North America and elsewhere.
# 
# Repeat: Please do not forget to add yourself to the list at
# https://wiki.hamburg.ccc.de/ChaosVPN:IPRanges to mark your
# range as used. 

owner=
# (mandatory, must include)
# Admin of the VPN gateway, with email address - a way to contact the
# responsible person in case of problems with your network link.
# (Does not need to contain real name, just a way to contact the person - if
# your node creates problems and we can not contact you it will just be
# disabled in the central config)

port=4711
# (optional)
# if not specified tinc works on tcp+udp port 655
# it is better if everyone chooses a random port for this.
# either this specified port or port 655 needs to accept TCP and UDP traffic
# from outside.

hidden=0
# (optional)
# "I cannot accept inbound tunnel connections, I can only connect out."
# (e.g. behind a NAT)
silent=0
# (optional)
# "I cannot connect out, but you can connect to me."
# Only ONE of hidden=1 or silent=1 is possible.

-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
....
-----END RSA PUBLIC KEY-----
# (mandatory, must include)
# rsa-public-key - contents of your /etc/tinc/chaos/rsa_key.pub

Next, send the template to chaosvpn-join@hamburg.ccc.de

At the same time please also add your network and node infos to
https://wiki.hamburg.ccc.de/ChaosVPN:IPRanges


Connecting to ChaosVPN
======================

Once you're approved, you can run the chaosvpn utility. chaosvpn takes
care of configuring tinc for you. The chaosvpn utility needs to be run
as root, but it surrenders its privileges as soon as possible.

If you used the Debian package you can enable starting the chaosvpn client
at boot time in /etc/default/chaosvpn, and manually start/stop/restart if
through /etc/init.d/chaosvpn.


If you have got any questions, join our irc channel #chaosvpn at
irc.hackint.eu (If you're already connected to the chaosvpn, you can
point your irc client to hackint.hack or 172.31.98.1 instead)
