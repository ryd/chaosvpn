chaosvpn (2.20-0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixes compilation with OpenSSL 1.1.0
  * Changed dependency from "iproute" to "iproute2"
    (github issue #20)
  * Fixed compilation with musl-libc by not requiring sys/cdefs.h
    in ar.h
    (https://wiki.musl-libc.org/faq.html, "Q: When compiling something
    against musl, I get error messages about sys/cdefs.h")
    (github issue #17)
  * Fixed lintian maintainer-script-should-not-use-dpkg-maintscript-helper

chaosvpn (2.19-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * $use_dynamic_routes: Support compressed IPv6 addresses in
    subnet-up/down shellscript, as used by latest tinc 1.1-git.
  * Replaced central config ecdsapublickey= with ed25519publickey=
    following tinc 1.1-git development.
  * Integrate /etc/tinc/chaos/ed25519_key.pub into generated
    hosts file for own node, because the hosts file is the only
    place that tinc searches for it.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sun, 23 Oct 2016 14:53:06 +0200

chaosvpn (2.18-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Include chaosvpn.conf template for OpenBSD.
  * Do not automatically restart tincd if it aborted cleanly with
    a fatal error.
    Can happen for example with config incompatibilities between tinc
    and chaosvpn, or if two instances of the same node are running on
    two different hosts and the conflict-resolution in tinc decided
    to kill one.
  * calcdebversion: Make the version number in "make deb" look nicer.
  * Created test_addrmask.c, a small test program to verify that the
    addressmask parsing and output functions work on a system.
    Use it as 'make test_addrmask && ./test_addrmask'
  * Makefile: Use BSD gcc parameters for all kinds of BSD, not just FreeBSD
  * addrmask_to_string(): use inet_ntop() on unix, and getnameinfo() only on
    win32 - fixes NetBSD support.
  * Added a couple of internal cleanups.

chaosvpn (2.17-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * addrmask_parse(): Fixed IP address parsing under OpenWRT by setting a
    missing ai_socktype for getaddrinfo() calls.
    Thanks to Thorben Went for debugging this.
  * addrmask.c: Fixed compile error on FreeBSD by including missing
    netinet/in.h
  * Fixed handling of nodes marked as silent=1
  * Added a couple of Apple OSX workarounds.
  * Added "make appleinstall" Makefile target.
  * More FreeBSD fixes.
  * Allow $tincd_bin to be specified as a relative path, searching for
    it in $PATH
  * tinc 1.1pre support: Starting with current git (and 1.1pre7) the binary
    that was called 'tincctl' is now just called 'tinc'. So change the
    default value and introduce new $tincctl_bin config variable.
  * warn only once about each unknown remote configstatement
  * support new central config statement ecdsapublickey= and if present
    and using tinc 1.1pre+ save it to hosts files.
  * Allow pingtest= in central config, but ignore it in client.
    (May be used later to automatically build icinga config or something
    like this)

chaosvpn (2.15-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Restore previous subnet-up/down behaviour for non-windows compiles.
  * addrmask.c: fix parsing and printing of ip addresses, got broken
    when implementing compiling under windows.
  * tinc.c: ensure all the strings used as char* are zero terminated.
  * make deb: fix to work with git tags starting with a "v" like "v2.14"

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Thu, 20 Sep 2012 21:16:21 +0200

chaosvpn (2.14-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Disable forwarding of broadcast packets - right now we have OSPF
    traffic on the VPN creating useless traffic.
  * Letting tinc use ipv6 as the transport protocol only creates problems
    for now, so reduced transport protocol to ipv4 only.
  * FreeBSD compilation fixes.
  * Windows compilation works for the first time, thanks to Guus!
    (But support not finished yet)
  * Compiled Debian Wheezy and Unstable packages with hardening enabled.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Tue, 28 Aug 2012 12:38:47 +0200

chaosvpn (2.12-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support (and use by default) tinc 1.0.17+ option LocalDiscovery=yes

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sat, 10 Mar 2012 16:03:34 +0100

chaosvpn (2.11-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not write Address= lines in tinc hosts files for hidden=1 nodes.
  * New config option $tincd_raw_config
  * Change default of AddressFamily back to 'ipv4'.
    The previous default of 'any' creates reachability problems for nodes
    reachable over ipv4 and ipv6 talking to ipv4-only nodes.
  * Some smaller internal changes.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Mon, 18 Jul 2011 12:59:36 +0200

chaosvpn (2.10-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of bugfixes.
  * Configuration option tincd_user to run tincd as non-root
    (Currently not active in the debian package, to be fixed)
  * Rework structure: make main chaosvpn process *completely* unprivileged
    (Currently not active in the debian package, to be fixed)
  * Option for the local admin to merge lots of chaosvpn routes into a
    small number of bigger supernet routes.
  * Option for the local admin to blacklist/whitelist routes received from
    the vpn.
  * Debian packaging switched from crontab/oneshot mode to daemon mode.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Fri, 27 May 2011 17:03:43 +0200

chaosvpn (2.06-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check that the OpenSSL headers used match the version of the
    OpenSSL library used.
    Output a warning if not.
    (Suggestion from wopot)
  * Added dependency to iproute package, needed for routing setup.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Thu, 27 Jan 2011 01:10:16 +0100

chaosvpn (2.05-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing segfault in log.c on 64bit linux (32bit linux worked).
    The combination of va_start(), vsyslog(), vfprintf(), va_end()
    seems invalid using 64bit glibc, in 32bit using the same version
    everything is great.
    va_start(), vsyslog(), va_end(), va_start(), vfprintf(), va_end()
    seems to work on both architectures.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Mon, 22 Nov 2010 00:25:17 +0100

chaosvpn (2.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Logging changes: do not output everything to stderr, only errors.
    Way nicer for cronjobs.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sun, 21 Nov 2010 22:06:01 +0100

chaosvpn (2.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dash does not support $RADOM, which is used in Debian cronjob.
    Package now requires bash instead until I find a better solution.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sun, 21 Nov 2010 21:31:07 +0100

chaosvpn (2.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Busybox ash does not support "case" statement fall-through, repeat
    the needed blocks instead.
    Repairs $use_dynamic_routes feature on embedded machines.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:11:02 +0100

chaosvpn (2.01-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Configfile parser fixups.
  * Make default configfiles a little bit simpler.
  * Manpage: mark $my_vpn_netmask as obsolete and move it to the bottom.
  * Allow admin to create tinc-up.local and tinc-down.local
  * Allow admin to create subnet-up.local and subnet-down.local
  * Fix test for httplib
  * Instantly abort on parse errors
  * crypto.c: Unlink tempfiles, do not let them lie around.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.1
  * Renamed config option "-a" to "-o" for 'oneshot mode' - describes
    better what it is really doing.
  * Renamed config option "-f" to "-r" for 'keep running'.
  * New commandline option "-d" for a real daemon mode with forking into
    the background.
  * Redirected (nearly) all output messages to syslog.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Wed, 13 Oct 2010 23:03:41 +0200

chaosvpn (2.0-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally released chaosvpn 2.0
  * Only create meta connections to a selected subset of nodes ("primary")
    when using tinc newer than 1.0.12, less load and tcp connections
    on end nodes.
    This breaks communication with nodes using tinc 1.0.12 and older,
    use config option $connect_only_to_primary_nodes=0 for old method
    of connecting to all non-hidden nodes.
  * New experimental config option $use_dynamic_routes
  * Optional configfile settings to specify VPN network interface name
    and path to tuntap device.
  * Include support to use tinc 1.1-git
  * Some basic compile fixes for FreeBSD

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sun, 11 Apr 2010 17:48:44 +0200

chaosvpn (2.0~rc11-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

    for tinc >> 1.0.12
  * Documentation and manpage updates.
  * Makefile changes for easier OpenWRT porting.
  * Debian: fix calls to invoke-rc.d, repair daily config reloads.

chaosvpn (2.0~rc10-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Multiple bugfixes

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Fri, 19 Feb 2010 23:05:29 +0100

chaosvpn (2.0~rc9-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: starting with this version we receive a different formatted data
    from the central server.
  * Note2: you need to incorporate some changes into your chaosvpn.conf

  * Data on the Server is now signed by a central master key, and then
    encrypted using the public part of our tinc key, and then all
    of this transmitted in one http request.
  * Usage of libcurl has been replaced by a small http get library.
  * In Daemon-Mode config re-fetching has been implemented.
  * Some memory leaks (mostly in error paths) have been fixed.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Thu, 28 Jan 2010 18:32:28 +0100

chaosvpn (2.0~rc8-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The major TODO of verifying a signature on the central configfile
    is finished, and lots of more changes.
  * The debian package buildscripts shouldn't need debhelper and quilt
    backports anymore, Lenny is enough.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Mon, 18 Jan 2010 22:48:04 +0100

chaosvpn (2.0~rc5-0.0) unstable; urgency=low
