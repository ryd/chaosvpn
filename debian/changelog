chaosvpn (2.14-0) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Disable forwarding of broadcast packets - right now we have OSPF
    traffic on the VPN creating useless traffic.
  * Letting tinc use ipv6 as the transport protocol only creates problems
    for now, so reduced transport protocol to ipv4 only.
  * FreeBSD compilation fixes.
  * Windows compilation works for the first time, thanks to Guus!
    (But support not finished yet)

chaosvpn (2.12-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support (and use by default) tinc 1.0.17+ option LocalDiscovery=yes

chaosvpn (2.11-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not write Address= lines in tinc hosts files for hidden=1 nodes.
  * New config option $tincd_raw_config
  * Change default of AddressFamily back to 'ipv4'.
    The previous default of 'any' creates reachability problems for nodes
    reachable over ipv4 and ipv6 talking to ipv4-only nodes.
  * Some smaller internal changes.

chaosvpn (2.10-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Lots of bugfixes.
  * Configuration option tincd_user to run tincd as non-root
    (Currently not active in the debian package, to be fixed)
  * Rework structure: make main chaosvpn process *completely* unprivileged
    (Currently not active in the debian package, to be fixed)
  * Option for the local admin to merge lots of chaosvpn routes into a
    small number of bigger supernet routes.
  * Option for the local admin to blacklist/whitelist routes received from
    the vpn.
  * Debian packaging switched from crontab/oneshot mode to daemon mode.

chaosvpn (2.06-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Check that the OpenSSL headers used match the version of the
    OpenSSL library used.
    Output a warning if not.
    (Suggestion from wopot)
  * Added dependency to iproute package, needed for routing setup.

chaosvpn (2.05-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixing segfault in log.c on 64bit linux (32bit linux worked).
    The combination of va_start(), vsyslog(), vfprintf(), va_end()
    seems invalid using 64bit glibc, in 32bit using the same version
    everything is great.
    va_start(), vsyslog(), va_end(), va_start(), vfprintf(), va_end()
    seems to work on both architectures.

chaosvpn (2.04-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Logging changes: do not output everything to stderr, only errors.
    Way nicer for cronjobs.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sun, 21 Nov 2010 22:06:01 +0100

chaosvpn (2.03-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dash does not support $RADOM, which is used in Debian cronjob.
    Package now requires bash instead until I find a better solution.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Sun, 21 Nov 2010 21:31:07 +0100

chaosvpn (2.02-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Busybox ash does not support "case" statement fall-through, repeat
    the needed blocks instead.
    Repairs $use_dynamic_routes feature on embedded machines.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Thu, 11 Nov 2010 17:11:02 +0100

chaosvpn (2.01-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Configfile parser fixups.
  * Make default configfiles a little bit simpler.
  * Manpage: mark $my_vpn_netmask as obsolete and move it to the bottom.
  * Allow admin to create tinc-up.local and tinc-down.local
  * Allow admin to create subnet-up.local and subnet-down.local
  * Fix test for httplib
  * Instantly abort on parse errors
  * crypto.c: Unlink tempfiles, do not let them lie around.
  * Standards-Version: 3.9.1
  * Renamed config option "-a" to "-o" for 'oneshot mode' - describes
    better what it is really doing.
  * Renamed config option "-f" to "-r" for 'keep running'.
  * New commandline option "-d" for a real daemon mode with forking into
    the background.
  * Redirected (nearly) all output messages to syslog.

chaosvpn (2.0-0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally released chaosvpn 2.0
  * Only create meta connections to a selected subset of nodes ("primary")
    when using tinc newer than 1.0.12, less load and tcp connections
    on end nodes.
    This breaks communication with nodes using tinc 1.0.12 and older,
    use config option $connect_only_to_primary_nodes=0 for old method
    of connecting to all non-hidden nodes.
  * New experimental config option $use_dynamic_routes
  * Optional configfile settings to specify VPN network interface name
    and path to tuntap device.
  * Include support to use tinc 1.1-git
  * Some basic compile fixes for FreeBSD

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Fri, 19 Feb 2010 23:05:29 +0100

chaosvpn (2.0~rc9-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Note: starting with this version we receive a different formatted data
    from the central server.
  * Note2: you need to incorporate some changes into your chaosvpn.conf

  * Data on the Server is now signed by a central master key, and then
    encrypted using the public part of our tinc key, and then all
    of this transmitted in one http request.
  * Usage of libcurl has been replaced by a small http get library.
  * In Daemon-Mode config re-fetching has been implemented.
  * Some memory leaks (mostly in error paths) have been fixed.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Thu, 28 Jan 2010 18:32:28 +0100

chaosvpn (2.0~rc8-0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * The major TODO of verifying a signature on the central configfile
    is finished, and lots of more changes.
  * The debian package buildscripts shouldn't need debhelper and quilt
    backports anymore, Lenny is enough.

 -- Sven-Haegar Koch <haegar@sdinet.de>  Mon, 18 Jan 2010 22:48:04 +0100
